cost of opening the gas meter varies according to the length of time you are prepared to wait.\\nEcovalians who want to open their gas meter should contact the supplier of their choice to take out a gas contract.\\nYou also need to arrange an appointment with a GRDF technician to activate your meter, as it is the GRDF network manager who is responsible for the commissioning of the gas meter at École-Valentin in the Franche-Comté region (25).\\nOn the day of the technician\\'s visit to your new accommodation, you will not have to pay anything as the fee will be added directly to your next invoice.\\nIf the gas has not been turned off on the day of your move to École-Valentin, then the technician\\'s pass is no longer necessary but you will still be charged 18.58€ including tax.\\nIf, on the other hand, the gas no longer works, then the Ecovalians will have the choice between 3 services: type of commissioning Timeframes 2 working days on the same day 143.01\\nYou have just moved into a new house in École-Valentin in the Franche-Comté region (25)?\\nRemember to connect your new home to natural gas and ask for a first commissioning.\\nThis will cost you €18.26 for a 10 working day response time.\\nOpen your meter at School-Valentine\\nThe steps to open his meter at École-Valentin are the same for gas as for electricity.\\nThe only parameters that will change are the contact numbers for Ecovalians and the rates.\\nWhat is the procedure for opening an electricity or gas meter?\\n1\\n.\\nFirstly, the inhabitants of 25 (Doubs) should check whether the housing meter in École-Valentin is properly connected to the Enedis (for electricity) or GrDF (for gas) network;\\n2.\\nIf the École-Valentin accommodation is not connected, it is necessary to contact the energy distributor and manager concerned; 3.\\nIf it is, Ecovalians can contact the supplier they want, be it the history (EDF for electricity and Engie for gas) or an alternative supplier (Eni, Direct Energie, etc...); 4.\\nDuring this stage, if the electricity at École-Valentin is functional (so it has not been turned off in the accommodation), you can proceed to the suite.\\nIf the opposite is the case, it is a matter of switching the meter into service in the 25th (Doubs).\\nEcovalians must make an appointment with Enedis or GrDF for a technician to come.\\nIt will not be necessary to see an Ecovalian technician arrive if the meter is a smart meter like Linky or Gazpar.\\n5.\\nYou have electricity at École-Valentin.\\nSharing the article Send To learn more about our policy on
